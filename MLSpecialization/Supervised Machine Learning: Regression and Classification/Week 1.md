## Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

The square error function for linear regression has a convex shape, only one local minima which is the global minima. This is a nice feature because we are not worried the function will converge at the wrong place. 

At the global minimum, the line fits the data the best. 

**Batch gradient descent**: At every step of the algorithm, we use all training examples not just a subset of the training data. The algorithm is looking at the entire training set at the same time
