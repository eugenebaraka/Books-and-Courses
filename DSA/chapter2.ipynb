    "- most common implementation of lists\n",
    "- a list with a few added rules (has some order) --> can contain same or different types of objects depending on a programming language\n",
    "- Each array has an index contrary to a list (?)\n",
    "- Insertion and deletion can be messy (especially when you want to move it in the middle --> pretty difficult and inneficient when you are inserting in the middle since you'll have to move elements after the inserted element back into differnt boxes/indeces) --> takes linear time (big O(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "- using python, a list is built as an array behind the scene. \n",
    "- Even though you can do many operations on a Python list with just one line of code, there's a lot of code built in to the Python language running to make that operation possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inserting an element into an array is O(n) since you may need to shift elements to make space for it, or even copy the whole array to a new one if run out of space. **Therefore, inserting in python is actually O(n)**. However, *operations that search for a particular element (indexing) are O(1)*\n",

    "\n",
    "SUMMARY (SO FAR): \n",
    "- A list in python is built on top of an array, so they behave almost the same\n",
    "- The largest time complexity cost comes from growing a list beyond its originally allocated size (i.e., moving items, inserting, deleting). Modifying (moving, deleting, inserting) objects in at the beginning of the list will have the largest cost because that means every item after that must move, in terms of index. \n",

    "- an extension of a list as well\n",

    "- each element has some notion of what the next element is but not necessarily how long it is. In an array, contrary, you know what the next element by its index\n",

    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGE: *easy to add or remove elements*. easy to change reference to the next element. [quick trick: if you delete the next reference to replace with a new object, you will lose your reference to the old one. assign your new object a reference first and procede to the previous one]. This takes constant time O(1)"
