Rules of writing code: 
- Correctness 
- Design
- Style

For most programming languages, C included, we need **a compiler** to convert the *source code* to the *machine code* (the language machines understand)

**Syntactic sugar**: 
For example for writing `counter = counter + 1`, we can summarize it as something like `counter += 1` or `counter ++`
